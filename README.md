## Introduction
The following project goal is to to create a deep learning program, using existing data set, capable of dating sediments in the ground. 


## Dataset used
The full data set is still in development. The current available data is located [here](https://github.com/shmooel28/finalProject/blob/master/data_b1.xlsx) 


## Training
We created 3 different Types of models for training. To train a single model run one of the following command:

    python Decision_tree.py

    python KNN.py

    python SVM.py
    
## Testing
